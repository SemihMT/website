                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>Skills & Studies </h3>
                <p>
                    I've been studying Game Development at Digital Arts & Entertainment for the past few years, learning
                    the ins-and-outs of <span class="highlight">modern C++</span>, <span class="highlight">C#</span>, <span class="highlight">Python</span>,
                    <span class="highlight">tool development</span>, <span
                        class="highlight">graphics programming</span> and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While studying, I've gained experience in quite a few relevant programs, such as: <span
                        class="highlight">Visual
                        Studio</span>, <span class="highlight">Unity</span>, <span class="highlight">Unreal
                        Engine</span>, <span class="highlight">Maya</span>, <span class="highlight">Blender</span>,
                    <span class="highlight">Git & Github</span>, <span class="highlight">Perforce</span>...
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I'm known for being both <span
                        class="highlight">independent</span> and a strong <span class="highlight">team player</span>.
                    I'm good at <span class="highlight">giving and receiving constructive feedback</span>, and I'm often
                    praised for my <span class="highlight">adaptability</span>
                    and <span class="highlight">problem-solving</span> abilities. I'm also skilled at <span
                        class="highlight">mentoring</span> and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>I've spent the past few years learning and improving my skills in game development and programming.
                    My experience
                    with <span class="highlight">Unity</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">Unreal Engine</span> has given me a solid understanding of game engines and
                    the
                    ability to adapt to new
                    technologies quickly. I've also developed a strong proficiency in <span class="highlight">modern
                        C++</span> and <span class="highlight">C#</span>, which has
                    allowed me to create tools and engines from scratch if need be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My ultimate career goal is to become an exceptional <span class="highlight">engine
                        programmer</span>, where
                    I can
                    utilize my technical skills to
                    optimize and improve game engines. However, I also love <span class="highlight">gameplay
                        programming</span> and the art
                    of crafting fun and engaging mechanics. I believe that a strong foundation in both engine and
                    gameplay programming will enable me to create games that are not only fun, but also memorable.
                </p> -->
                <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently on the lookout for an <span class="highlight">end-of-study internship</span> for the
                    second semester as an <span class="highlight">engine programmer</span> or <span class="highlight">tool developer</span>.<br> (10 Feb. 2025 - 13 Jun.
                    2025)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a programmer with a strong foundation in graphics programming, as can be seen in my
                    projects.
                    However, I'd like to leverage my experience in graphics programming to learn more about
                    engine qnd tool development in order to become a more well-rounded developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Currently, my portfolio mostly reflects my graphics programming work, with some exceptions like P4Engine. 
                   I am however working on projects that align more with engine and tool development in my free time.
                </p>
                <!-- <h3>Why Game Development?</h3>
                <p>
                    I grew up in a home where video games were (mostly) frowned upon, resulting in me never getting a
                    flagship game console and only interacting with video games via my cousins and their PlayStation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This wasn't an issue for me, seeing as my cousins kept playing either that year's FIFA or one of the
                    many shooter games they owned. I was never any good in either of those games anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But one day when I came to visit, they booted up this new game they bought. Where you play as a
                    little sackboy, exploring every nook and cranny of the handmade-looking levels, finding stickers,
                    decorating the world with them and so much more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The colorful design, the happy music, and most of all, the fun we had playing Little Big Planet
                    opened my eyes to the potential of games as a medium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following that realization, I played games with a new appreciation for their makers. This
                    appreciation grew over time into a curiosity, which shaped my interests throughout middle and high
                    school. I knew I wanted to create games like Little Big Planet, not just for myself, but also in the
                    hopes of inspiring others to do the same.
                </p>
                <sub class="spoiler">
                    No offense to FIFA or shooter games, I just wasn't good at them at the time :)

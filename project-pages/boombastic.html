                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Boombastic: Calavera Carnaval is a game we had to make during our "Game Projects" course.
                    We were randomly gathered into teams with an (almost) even distribution of developers & artists.
                    Our goal was to create a couch Co-Op game from start to finish using either Unreal Engine or Unity.
                    During the whole development process we were guided by two amazing team leads, Alex & Tristan, who
                    gave us the necessary feedback to push through some of the roadblocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting acquianted with the team, we started brainstorming for the perfect Co-Op game.
                    We went through ideas such as farming and destroying each others' crops, ragdoll parkour where you'd
                    need to help each other to progress and some variation of "playing tag".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tag was a nice idea, but we couldn't immediately see how we would translate that to our videogame,
                    when one of us suggested that we could add some fun chaos to the mix by incorporating a ball-like
                    object. Kind of like "hot potato" they said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we got confirmation from our team leads that this idea would be feasible, we immediately went
                    to work. And a short 5 months later Boombastic was born.
                </p>

                    As one of the programmers I worked on:

                    <li><b>The Bomb:</b> the bomb has special physics when thrown to ensure chaos while keeping the
                        gameplay fair.</li>

                    <li><b>Scene Management:</b> switching scenes and dynamically changing them depending on who won &
                        who lost.</li>

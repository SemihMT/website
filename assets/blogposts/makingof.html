        <h1>Why did I make SemihTeke.com</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I love creating things. I love learning. I love expressing myself through what I make.
            That&#39;s it, that&#39;s literally why I decided on making this website from scratch. </p>
        <p>It was summertime and I knew I needed a portfolio for the career fair DAE organizes. I thought about using a
            website builder like Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace or the 1001 other ones out there. I tried some of them, but
            ultimately I felt restricted. </p>
        <p>Making the website was challenging, especially because I had never done web development before. I chose the
            most basic tech stack there was: HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript without any frameworks and got to work. Using
            resources from all around the web, I learned and applied what I&#39;d learned directly to my website. One of
            the most influential resources I&#39;ve used was <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin
                Project</a>, a curated curriculum of resources designed to make a full stack developer out of everyone
            that follows it. </p>
        <p>I spent my off time on the website, trying things out. Seeking feedback from my family and friends to gauge
            what works and what doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s been a satisfying process, albeit sometimes tiring and
            frustrating. Especially when trying to host self-made C &amp; C++ games by using Emscripten to port them to
            WASM &amp; WebGL. </p>
        <p>I&#39;m proud of this website and what it has become; I&#39;ll probably rewrite it once I get better at web
            development sometime in the future. I&#39;d like to have a set of tools directly integrated into VSCode or
            create my own text editor that is directly connected to the FTPS server this website lives on, allowing for
            easier creation &amp; editing of webpages. But that&#39;s for future me.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading! <br>
